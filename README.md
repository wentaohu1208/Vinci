With the continuous development of large language models and reasoning chain technologies, the potential of deep reasoning based on reinforcement learning has shown remarkable promise in multi-task scenarios. However, existing unified models have yet to achieve end-to-end integration in image generation and understanding tasks, limiting the model’s self-reflection ability and the realization of cross-modal reasoning chains. To address this, we propose Vinic, a novel framework designed to enable interleaved image generation and understanding through deep reasoning capabilities. We leverage a small amount of multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) data for cold-start and employ reinforcement learning to guide the integration of image generation and understanding tasks. Additionally, we introduce a momentum-based reward function, which dynamically adjusts the reward distribution by considering historical improvements, ensuring the stability of the model across multiple generations. Experimental results demonstrate that integrating MCoT can achieve a +22% improvement over the base model on Geneval, effectively enhancing both image generation quality and instruction alignment capabilities.
